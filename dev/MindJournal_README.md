The app includes a dynamic **brain-style visualization**:

- Few notes → small network
- More notes → dense network

---

## 🧭 Layout

- Left sidebar: search, date filter, theme switcher, view switcher, Library list
- Focus Mode hides the utility controls and keeps Search, Library, Activity Map, and Editor visible
- Left sidebar controls also include sort and quick tag filtering from the Library
- Top right: activity map visualization
- Right panel: note editor for the currently selected note

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Desktop: centered layout
- Tablet: grid layout
- Mobile: stacked layout, full-screen editor

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

- Minimal
- Calm
- Distraction-free
- Apple-inspired UI

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No cloud sync
- Data stored only in browser
- Clearing browser storage removes notes
- Imported notes merge locally by note `id`
- Delete undo is available only for the latest deleted note in the current session

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Optional)

- User login
- Markdown support
